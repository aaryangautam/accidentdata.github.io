    <h1>Traffic Accident Map</h1>

    <p> <b>Welcome to the traffic map!</b>  Below is the graph that shows number of accidents in specific locations. 
    </p>
    <p> <b>My hypothesis is that the highest concentration of accidents are located in big cities and along the highways.</b></p>

    <p> In this section, you can sort by month to see the highest concentration of accidents. Didn't really have a hypothesis associated with this, but it's interesting to see how the most accidents are during the winter months. It makes sense, given the icy conditions during this time period.
